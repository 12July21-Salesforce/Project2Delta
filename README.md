# Project Details
For this project, Team Amplifier Delta took on the project of Team Synergy, Our goal was to iterate what was previously created, by stepping away from Visualforce and into Aura Compoenents. To do this each member of our team took one page to convert to an Aura Component, and also implemented a business fucntional Aura Component.

# Each Contributors Role:
Allen created a list aura component to show customers and the realtor they are assigned to, Allen's second component added a aura header to the page.

David created a lot filter list for the site that allows you to type text into a search box to filter lots by name, and David's second component is a list of all lots with pagination added to the component.

Robert created the BuyerSearch aura component that allows users to search on a table that displays records based on User input. This table specifically shows records of Lots that are sold. The second component is the QuickContract quick action that allows the user to quickly create a contract on the lot record page.

Sam-- Neighborhood object-aura component that displays picture of a Neighborhood, that after click directs to related picture of lots.  Second component, a visual construction progress 'process' that is based on the Status__c picklist field

Alex Created a list of Realtors, with creation functionality. The pages list refreshes upon completion of creating the new Realtor. The second component Alex utilized is a creation feature and a card list for commissions for the realtors, with the ability to make a slider stating if the commission was paid or not.

# How to import:
Step 1. Enable Expirence Cloud (setup => features => digital experience => settings => “Enable Experience Cloud Site” => enter unique domain name).

Step 2. Change usernames on the sites (open VisualStudio => open the sites tab => change the admin and guest admin emails to the sys admin in org).

# <-- Optional -->
For the Web-to-lead to work correctly, the url redirect needs to be changed to the url geneerated for your org. After creating the domain name, you need to update the domain name in the html markup to match what was created for your org.
